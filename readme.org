#+title: Org Blog

Hopefully the last time I overengineer my blog.

- A static blog generator written in clojure
- Pulls content primarily from an org(-roam) directory
- Uses clerk to define and render the content
  - Plus tools for visualizations, images, etc
- Uses org-crud to parse (and crud) the org content
  - Supports an interactive review process
    - reading+writing to the org files
    - adding additional tags
    - linking notes
- Depends on clawe (initially, anyway)
